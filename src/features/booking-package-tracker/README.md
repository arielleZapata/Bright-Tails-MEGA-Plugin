# Booking Package Tracker Feature

This folder is reserved for the future Booking Package Tracker feature.

## Planned Structure

When implemented, this feature will likely include:
- `booking-package-tracker.php` - Main PHP file for the feature
- `index.js` - Editor block JavaScript (if block-based)
- `frontend.js` - Frontend JavaScript (if needed)
- `block.json` - Block configuration (if block-based)
- `style.css` - Styles for the feature
- `render.php` - Server-side rendering template (if block-based)

## Implementation Notes

- All feature PHP should be in a dedicated `.php` file
- Feature will be loaded from `index.php` at the plugin root
- Follow the same organizational structure as `pet-profile` feature
